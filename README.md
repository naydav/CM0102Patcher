It also has a tools section with things like a patch applier that can apply .patch files from things like Flex 2 or patch files made with "fc /b cm0102_original.exe cm0102_patched.exe > newpatch.patch"

An unfinished scouter, based on CM Scout, but allows you to view and sort by the "intrinsic" skills value (can load compressed and uncompressed saves)

Also there is a little officials.dat patcher for patching up referees as per recent discussions on getting too many red cards from recent updates:

## Updates
v1.03:
* Added back the 1280x800 resolution patch! Now working and will resize all your 800x600 images to 1280x800 - so any graphics pack that works with 800x600 can automatically convert to working in 1280x800!
* CM Scout inspired Save Scouter which also shows Intrinsic values - yet to be finished! So very Alpha!

v1.02:
* History (players, competitions, etc) is also advanced in time when changing the start year
* Removed the 1280x800 resolution patch option until I can get it fully working
* Added option to boost the chances when applying for jobs abroad
